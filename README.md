# java-caesar-cipher

Caesar Cipher made in Java! It is a type of cipher in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. You can encrypt as well as decrypt text using this :)
